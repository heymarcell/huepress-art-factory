# Advanced Image Features Walkthrough

## 1. Image Version Control

- **Feature**: Users can now view history of all generation attempts for an idea.
- **UI**: A "Versions" list of thumbnails appears below the main image in the Idea Detail panel.
- **Action**: Clicking a thumbnail switches the active image for that idea (updates `selected_attempt_id` in database).
- **Feedback**: The active version is highlighted with a blue border.

## 2. Image Zoom (Lightbox)

- **Feature**: Click on the main image in the Detail Panel to open a full-screen Lightbox view.
- **UI**: High-resolution image on dark background. Click anywhere or X button to close.

## 3. New 'Omitted' Status

- **Feature**: 'Omitted' has been added to the status dropdown.
- **Usage**: Use this to mark ideas that should be ignored/archived without deleting them.

## 4. 'Approved' State Logic

- **Feature**: When an idea is marked as 'Approved':
  - The **Generate** button is disabled.
  - The **Delete** button is disabled.
- **Purpose**: Prevent accidental modification or deletion of finalized assets.

- **Side-by-Side View**:

## Debugging & Polish Session

### Gemini Generation Fixes
- **Model Update**: Switched to `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` for high-quality vector art.
- **Config Correction**: Resolved "Invalid Argument" and "Media resolution not enabled" errors.
  - Removed `mediaResolution` (input-only parameter).
  - Used `imageConfig: { imageSize: '4K' }` for correct Ultra-High Definition output.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Reverted to JSON input structure to play nicely with the detailed `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` JSON.

### UX Improvements
- **Auto-Switch**: The UI now automatically selects and displays the newly generated image immediately upon completion, thanks to a backend update to `selected_attempt_id`.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Added Left/Right arrow key support to browse through generation attempts (versions) in the Detail view.
- **Resolution Badge**: Added a small badge in the top-left corner of the image preview to display the actual rendered dimensions (e.g., 4096 x 4096).
