# Advanced Image Features Walkthrough

## 1. Image Version Control
- **Feature**: Users can now view history of all generation attempts for an idea.
- **UI**: A "Versions" list of thumbnails appears below the main image in the Idea Detail panel.
- **Action**: Clicking a thumbnail switches the active image for that idea (updates `selected_attempt_id` in database).
- **Feedback**: The active version is highlighted with a blue border.

## 2. Image Zoom (Lightbox)
- **Feature**: Click on the main image in the Detail Panel to open a full-screen Lightbox view.
- **UI**: High-resolution image on dark background. Click anywhere or X button to close.

## 3. New 'Omitted' Status
- **Feature**: 'Omitted' has been added to the status dropdown.
- **Usage**: Use this to mark ideas that should be ignored/archived without deleting them.

## 4. 'Approved' State Logic
- **Feature**: When an idea is marked as 'Approved':
  - The **Generate** button is disabled.
  - The **Delete** button is disabled.
- **Purpose**: Prevent accidental modification or deletion of finalized assets.
