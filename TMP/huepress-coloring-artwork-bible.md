# 1\. Value Proposition of the Graphics

-   **One-Sentence Promise:** We produce "Bold & Easy" vector-quality art that builds creative confidence in children and reduces visual overwhelm for parents and therapists.
    
-   **3 Proof Points:**
    
    1.  **Therapy-Grade Clarity:** Every line is thick, continuous, and high-contrast to support fine motor development and visual tracking.
        
    2.  **Zero-Frustration Design:** Closed paths and large fill areas ensure markers don't bleed and colors stay within the lines, delivering a dopamine hit of "completion."
        
    3.  **Vector-Perfect Polish:** Print-ready resolution at any size, with no pixelation, artifacts, or "clip-art" fuzziness.
        
-   **"Not This / But This" Contrast:**
    
    1.  **Not:** Thin, scratchy, sketch-style lines. **But:** Confident, uniform, marker-weight strokes.
        
    2.  **Not:** Cluttered backgrounds full of noise. **But:** Intentional negative space that lets the subject breathe.
        
    3.  **Not:** Generic, dated clip-art (1990s style). **But:** Curated, modern studio aesthetic (sticker style).
        
    4.  **Not:** "Worksheet" vibes (boring/clinical). **But:** "Dopamine Decor" vibes (cute/inviting).
        
    5.  **Not:** Tiny, frustration-inducing details. **But:** Satisfyingly large, colorable regions.
        
    6.  **Not:** Grayscale shading or pre-filled gray. **But:** 100% black ink on 100% white paper.
        

# 2\. Core Style DNA

## 2.1 Style Keywords (10) + Anti-Keywords (10)

| **Style Keywords** | **Anti-Keywords** |
| --- | --- |
| **Chunky** | Sketchy |
| **Vector** | Pixelated |
| **Rounded** | Jagged |
| **Spacious** | Cluttered |
| **Kawaii (Modern)** | Grotesque |

| **Joyful** | Clinical |
| **Iconic** | Generic |

## 2.2 The “Bold & Easy” Definition

-   **Visually (The Rules):**
    
    -   **Monolinear Weight:** Lines do not taper; they maintain a consistent thickness (like a monoline marker).
        
    -   **Closed Paths:** All shapes must be fully enclosed. No "open" line endings that leave coloring areas undefined.
        
    -   **Rounded Terminals:** All line ends and corners use rounded caps/joins to feel soft and safe.
        
    -   **High Contrast:** Absolute black (#000000) on absolute white (#FFFFFF).
        
-   **Cognitively (The Why):**
    
    -   **Low Cognitive Load:** The brain instantly recognizes the subject without decoding visual noise.
        
    -   **Motor Success:** The thick boundary acts as a "bumper lane" for crayons/markers, physically helping the child stay in the lines.
        
    -   **Calm:** The absence of micro-details reduces visual anxiety and overstimulation.
        

## 2.3 Audience Mapping

### Audience A: Aesthetic Millennial Mom

-   **Style Requirement 1:** **Modern Subjects:** (e.g., Bubble tea, Axolotls, Succulents) vs. dated tropes.
    
-   **Style Requirement 2:** **Sticker Aesthetic:** Subjects should look like die-cut stickers (self-contained).
    
-   **Style Requirement 3:** **Balance:** High signal-to-noise ratio.
    
-   **Style Requirement 4:** **Cute Factor:** Round eyes, chubby proportions, "squish" factor.
    
-   **Style Requirement 5:** **Print Economy:** Bold lines, but no massive solid black fills that drain ink cartridges.
    
-   **Avoid:** Scary/Grotesque faces, excessive text, low-res fuzziness, "boys vs girls" stereotypes, chaotic scenes.
    

### Audience B: Pediatric OT / SLP

-   **Style Requirement 1:** **Visual Closure:** Shapes must be complete so the eye can track the form.
    
-   **Style Requirement 2:** **Figure-Ground:** Strong separation between the subject and the background.
    
-   **Style Requirement 3:** **Bilateral Coordination:** Designs that encourage holding the paper with one hand while coloring.
    
-   **Style Requirement 4:** **Graded Difficulty:** Clear progression from big shapes (Level 1) to smaller shapes (Level 3).
    
-   **Style Requirement 5:** **Context Clues:** Subjects should be recognizable objects to support vocabulary building (SLP).
    
-   **Avoid:** Ambiguous shapes, distracting background patterns, overlapping lines that confuse depth, tiny gaps (<3mm), thin lines that are hard to see.
    

# 3\. Line Art Specification (Hard Rules)

## 3.1 Line Weight & Stroke Behavior

-   **Primary Contour (Outer Boundary):**
    
    -   **Thickness:** 4pt - 6pt (at US Letter size).
        
    -   **Role:** Defines the silhouette. Must be the thickest line on the page to separate subject from background.
        
-   **Secondary Detail (Inner Lines):**
    
    -   **Thickness:** 3pt - 4pt.
        
    -   **Role:** Defines internal features (eyes, spots, clothing). Must never be thicker than the contour.
        
-   **Variation Policy:** **NEVER** use pressure-sensitive tapering (thick-to-thin). Lines must be uniform width.
    

## 3.2 Shape Language

-   **Corners & Caps:** Always use **Round Cap** and **Round Join** settings in vector software. No sharp miters.
    
-   **Proportions:** "Chibification" (Chibi style). Heads larger than bodies. Limbs shorter and thicker. Eyes wide set.
    
-   **Facial Features:** Simple. Dot eyes or simple ovals. Smiles are simple curves. No noses unless essential (e.g., elephant).
    
-   **Simplification:** Reduce complex textures (fur, grass) to iconic representations (a few tufts, a few blades).
    

## 3.3 Clarity & Separation

-   **Minimum Gap Size:** No two lines should be closer than **3mm** apart. If they are closer, merge them or move them.
    
-   **Overlap Rules:**
    
    -   **Forbidden:** Transparent overlaps (seeing a line _through_ another object).
        
    -   **Allowed:** Occclusion (one object clearly in front of another, blocking the line behind it).
        
-   **Foreground/Background:** The subject must never touch the page edge. Always leave a "halo" of whitespace around the main subject.
    

# 4\. Complexity System (Difficulty Levels)

## Level 1: "Toddler / Heavy Motor Delay"

-   **Target:** Ages 2-3 / Significant Fine Motor challenges.
    
-   **Region Count:** 1 - 5 large regions.
    
-   **Details:** Zero micro-details. Eyes are solid dots.
    
-   **Background:** None (Pure White).
    
-   **Adaptation:** Maximum line weight (6pt+).
    
-   _Concept:_ A single, large apple with a leaf. No background.
    

## Level 2: "Pre-K / Moderate Motor Control"

-   **Target:** Ages 3-5 / Developing grip.
    
-   **Region Count:** 6 - 15 regions.
    
-   **Details:** Minimal. Simple patterns (e.g., stripes on a shirt).
    
-   **Background:** Minimal (e.g., ground line or clouds).
    
-   **Adaptation:** Standard line weight (4pt-5pt).
    
-   _Concept:_ A cat sitting on a rug with a ball of yarn.
    

## Level 3: "Elementary / Mild Motor Control"

-   **Target:** Ages 5-8 / Refined grip.
    
-   **Region Count:** 16 - 30 regions.
    
-   **Details:** Moderate. Texture suggestions (scales, bricks).
    
-   **Background:** Moderate (e.g., trees, stars, bubbles).
    
-   **Adaptation:** Standard line weight (3pt-4pt internal).
    
-   _Concept:_ An astronaut floating in space with a rocket and 3-4 planets.
    

## Level 4: "Tween / Focus Flow"

-   **Target:** Ages 8+ / Anxiety relief / Focus.
    
-   **Region Count:** 30 - 50 regions (Repeating patterns).
    
-   **Details:** Pattern-based (e.g., mandala-lite, food spread).
    
-   **Background:** Full page usage allowed (but keeping safe margins).
    
-   **Adaptation:** Still bold lines, just denser composition.
    
-   _Concept:_ A pattern of floating sushi and bubble tea cups filling the page.
    

# 5\. Composition & Page Architecture

## 5.1 Default Page Layout

-   **Subject Scale:** Main subject should occupy **60-75%** of the printable area.
    
-   **Negative Space:** Target **25-40%** white space (excluding Level 4 patterns).
    
-   **Safe Margins:**
    
    -   **Top/Bottom:** 0.75 inch (19mm).
        
    -   **Left/Right:** 0.75 inch (19mm).
        
    -   _Reason:_ Home printers often cut off edges. Centering is critical.
        

## 5.2 Background & Pattern Rules

-   **Allowed:**
    
    -   **Big Shapes:** Large polka dots, stars, hearts (Level 3-4).
        
    -   **Grounding:** A simple horizon line to place the character.
        
-   **Forbidden:**
    
    -   **Noise:** Hatching, stippling, grunge textures.
        
    -   **Tight Repeats:** Patterns where elements are smaller than a dime (18mm).
        

## 5.3 Text Usage Rules

-   **Placement:** Only if integral (e.g., "A is for Apple" or Affirmation cards).
    
-   **Font Style:** Rounded Sans Serif (e.g., Varela Round, M Plus Rounded). **Never** script or calligraphy (hard to color).
    
-   **Readability:** Text must be outlined (hollow) to be colorable, with minimum 4pt stroke.
