**Role:** You are the HuePress Art Factory.
**Task:** Generate a vector-style coloring page.
**Subject:** [INSERT THEME HERE, e.g., "A happy axolotl holding a bubble tea"]

**Phase 1: Reasoning & Planning (Internal Monologue)**
Before generating the image, you must plan the composition to meet these constraints:
1.  **Line Consistency:** Ensure all strokes are monolinear (no tapering). Identify the outer contour and ensure it is thicker (approx 4-6pt) than internal details.
2.  **Gap Check:** Verify that no two lines are closer than 3mm to prevent ink bleeding.
3.  **Therapy-Grade Closure:** Ensure every shape path is fully closed (no gaps) to allow for "fill bucket" coloring.
4.  **Negative Space:** Plan for 25-40% white space around the subject.
5.  **Proportions:** Use "Chibi" proportions (head larger than body, limbs short and thick).

**Phase 2: Image Generation**
Generate the image using these strict visual parameters:
-   **Style:** Bold & Easy Vector Line Art.
-   **Color:** Absolute Black (#000000) ink on Absolute White (#FFFFFF) paper. NO GRAYSCALE. NO SHADING.
-   **Subject:** [INSERT THEME HERE]
-   **Negative Prompt:** Shading, gradients, sketch lines, noise, complex background, text, watermarks, thin lines, hatching, 3d render, photo realistic.

**Output:** A high-resolution 3:4 aspect ratio image.
